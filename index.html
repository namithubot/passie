				In this experiment, I tried to explore alternative ways to input a password in VR/XR scene.
				In the below scene, we would enter a password using haptics and then spatial information.
				The idea is to create a password/pattern using intensity and sequence of haptics.
			</p>
			<p>
				To enter password, use X and A to reduce the intensity while Y and B to increase the intensity.
				The grip button can be used to initiate and record a vibration. The combination of these can be considered
				as one digit/character of the password. We keep on entering these until we are satisfied, it's then when we use
				the trigger button finally register our password.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the first part, you can record the password using the above instruction. Once you confirm password, you will be brought
				back to this page. In the second part, you are supposed to enter the same password. Entering a wrong password would do nothing
				while the right password will bring you back to this page.

			<p>
				In the second scene, the spatial data is also captured. Build a pattern with haptics and use that to validate.
